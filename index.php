            <p>
                Pilates Develops Core Strength. The core muscles of the body are the deep muscles of the back,
                abdomen, and pelvic floor. These are the muscles we rely on to support a strong, supple back,
                good posture, and efficient movement patterns. When the core is strong,
                the frame of the body is supported. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us
                for more information.
