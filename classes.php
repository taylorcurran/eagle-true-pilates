        Eagle True Pilates offers classes for all levels, from beginners to advanced students,
        in different styles of pilates lead by various teachers and their personal approach,
        shaped by their own experience and studies. At Eagle True Pilates, we aim to approach pilates philosophy
        and practice holistically, a path demonstrated Akhanda Yand Sadhana pilates. Akhanda, meaning whole
        or indivisible in Sanskrit indicates a holistic approach that embraces the four traditional paths
        of pilates. Sadhana means spiritual practice and indicates that all pilates practice is considered an inner
        spiritual journey.

    <h3>RESTORATIVE / YIN YOGA</h3>
    <p>
        Restorative/ Yin yoga is the spiritual practice of yoga based on the concepts and restorative or yin yoga.
        Compared to Hatha or Vinyasa Yoga, which would be considered a yang practice to stimulate and invigorate us,
        yin and restorative yoga soothes and calms us. Poses are held for between 3-5 minutes and we use bolsters,
        blocks, straps to support and deepen each pose. Learning to stay in a pose for longer periods of time trains
        the mind to become calm and endure distraction, both mental and physical. This in turn cultivates physical
        ease and mental calm. We come out of the practice refreshed and rejuvenated each afternoon.
