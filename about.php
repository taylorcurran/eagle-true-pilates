            <h2>Concious Business</h2>
            <p>
                More than just a retreat center, Eagle True Pilates shares a conscious business model integrating
                three pillars in a balanced practice of earth care, people care and fair share.
                Integrating our understanding of what it is to be a conscious business, through social,
                ecological and economic structures, we recognize that this journey will be ever unfolding.
                Through our non-profit Forest Family Foundation, we strive to support and integrate conscious
                living practices in the local community through humanitarian and ecological projects, while sharing
                the principles of working within nature creating interactive landscapes of beauty and productivity.

                Together, with the help of amazing foreign staff and a beautiful crew of local Mayans,
                many wonderful things have been created here and there is always more to be done. We love to connect
                with people who prioritize a way of life that harmonizes nature with spirit.

                Eagle True Pilates has been built using various natural and traditional building methods.
                We use solar energy for simple electricity and hot water, natural grey water filtering systems for
                our kitchen and outdoor showers, and outdoor composting toilets to return our offerings to the earth.
                We try our best to produce as little waste as possible and continue to explore new endeavors to
                create a more sustainable retreat lifestyle.

                <h3>"Great Teacher!"</h3>
                <p>
                    I was suffering with sciatic pain for a year,
                    I did not want to take medication or have surgery.
                    I tried physical therapy and Feldenkrais to relieve the pain.
                    Both were somewhat helpful but I still could not ride my horse, do chores,
                    or even walk around the neighborhood without chronic pain.
                    I was actually looking for a yoga class when I found Julia’s Pilates class.
                    I began Pilates in May, 2016. I have been going twice weekly and the difference
                    is amazing. I can ride my horse (number one priority), do yard work, and take walks.
                    These were all activities that I could not do before Julia’s Pilates classes.
                    I have my life back! Julia is a great teacher

                <p>“Thank you Hayley and the team for everything. Eagle True Pilates is a very special place,
                    made with love and beautifully cared for, it was a real joy to spend a few days here.
                    I will definitely be returning at some point in the future. I really enjoyed the Permaculture talks
                    - very inspiring, and wonderful to have pilates first thing in the morning.
                    All the meals were outstanding, and special thanks to the ladies in the kitchen who work so hard.
                    All the best and good luck in the future.”
